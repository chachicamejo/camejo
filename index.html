          <p>Hello everyone,</p>
          
          <p>As we approach the 24th of March, which marks the 9th anniversary since my father passed away, I'd like to take advantage and reconnect with everyone who collectively shared a time of their life with José Camejo. José manage to touch so many peoples' lives in a positive and unique way. It might have been through his love for music, photography, design, art, language, politics, spirituality, Cuba, conspiracy, literature, people or any other topic that José was able to sit and talk for hours about. I'm sure many of those conversations have been repeated many times since.</p>
          <p>My father was, is and will always be on of the most influential people in my life. I only wish I had time to learn more about who he was and where he came from. As a kid I was still discovering who I was, and didn't take the opportunity to understand where I came from. Well, today it's my turn to teach my daughters a little about their Camejo history [Brianna is 11 years old and Valentina is 5 years old]. I am, however, going to need a little help from all of you. I think it would an incredible way for my girls, and myself, to better understand who their grandfather was if we heard it first hand from someone who shared a moment in time with him.</p>
          <p>My idea is that I can get a few of you to share a photo or story with me, I'll then share with my daughters on the 24th as we celebrate his life. I'm also looking for leads to any Camejo family. If after the 24th you still have more to share or opt to use this page as a means to keep in touch, feel free. I'll keep the page up and maybe one day turn it into something more. As I receive photos, I'll add a gallery to this page to share among you all.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to hearing from all of you.</p>
          <p>- Chachi</p>
